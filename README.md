Executive Summary:
This comprehensive exploratory data analysis examines 46 years of AMD stock market performance (1980-2026), analyzing over 11,000 trading days to uncover investment patterns, risk profiles, and strategic opportunities. Using advanced SQL analytics and data visualization, I identified key performance drivers, volatility patterns, and technical indicators that inform investment decision-making.

Business Problem:
Individual investors and financial analysts need data-driven insights to make informed decisions about AMD stock investments. However, raw historical data alone doesn't provide:
What is the actual risk-adjusted return?
How risky is AMD compared to market benchmarks?
When are optimal entry and exit points?
What's the maximum potential loss (drawdown)?
Do moving averages provide actionable buy/sell signals?
